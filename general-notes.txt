Encryption/Decryption

How do I base64-encode something?

Use the enc -base64 option.

# send encoded contents of file.txt to stdout
$ openssl enc -base64 -in file.txt

# same, but write contents to file.txt.enc
$ openssl enc -base64 -in file.txt -out file.txt.enc

It’s also possible to do a quick command-line encoding of a string value:

$ echo "encode me" | openssl enc -base64
ZW5jb2RlIG1lCg==

Note that echo will silently attach a newline character to your string. Consider using its -n option if you want to avoid that situation, which could be important if you’re trying to encode a password or authentication string.

$ echo -n "encode me" | openssl enc -base64
ZW5jb2RlIG1l

Use the -d (decode) option to reverse the process.

$ echo "ZW5jb2RlIG1lCg==" | openssl enc -base64 -d
encode me

How do I simply encrypt a file?

Simple file encryption is probably better done using a tool like GPG. Still, you may have occasion to want to encrypt a file without having to build or use a key/certificate structure. All you want to have to remember is a password. It can nearly be that simple—if you can also remember the cipher you employed for encryption.

To choose a cipher, consult the enc(1) man page. More simply (and perhaps more accurately), you can ask openssl for a list in one of two ways.

# see the list under the 'Cipher commands' heading
$ openssl -h

# or get a long list, one cipher per line
$ openssl list-cipher-commands

After you choose a cipher, you’ll also have to decide if you want to base64-encode the data. Doing so will mean the encrypted data can be, say, pasted into an email message. Otherwise, the output will be a binary file.

# encrypt file.txt to file.enc using 256-bit AES in CBC mode
$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc

# the same, only the output is base64 encoded for, e.g., e-mail
$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc

To decrypt file.enc you or the file’s recipient will need to remember the cipher and the passphrase.

# decrypt binary file.enc
$ openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in file.enc

# decrypt base64-encoded version
$ openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -a -in file.enc

*** mounting shared folders inside the virtual Linux instance.
    Virtualbox's automount is broken. To reliably share folders between
    the host and the guest operating systems:
    - Mark the folders you want to share in the VM's settings, but don't
      choose auto-mount.
    - Start the VM.
    - Add the following line to /etc/fstab
      Documents /media/Documents vboxsf uid=1000,gid=1000,nodev,noexec,nosuid,auto,rw 0 0
    - reboot for Magic
*** Getting rid of piix4_smbus 0000.00.07.0: SMBus base address uninitialized
    - Check if the module is being loaded
      # lsmod | grep i2c_piix4
    - blacklist it in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf by adding the following line to it:
      # blacklist i2c_piix4
    - Update initramfs
      # update-initramfs -u -k all
